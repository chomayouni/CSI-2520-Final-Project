    <h2 id="historyT">History</h2>
    <p id="RallyHistory">Rally cars and rally racing has a huge history to it that spans from 1894 all the way to the present day. As this page, I'll be focusing on the history of the group B category of rally racing and rally cars. Group B was first introduced by the FIA(Federation Internationale de l'Automobile) in 1982. Compared to the other categories of rally racing, group B had fewer restrictions on technology, design and the number of cars required for homologation to compete, about 200 less than the other categories. Weight was also kept as low as possible, high-tech materials were permitted, and there were no restrictions on turbo boost, which resulted in the power output of winning cars to increase up to 500 horsepower. Group B  was initially very successful group compared to the other group categories. Many manufacturers joined the premier World Rally Championship and the number of specators increased. Although, the cost of of competing quickly rose and the performance of the cars proved too much in a series of fatal crashes. As a consequence, Group B was canceled at the end of 1986 and Group A regulations became the standard for all cars until the advent of World Rally Cars in 1997. While this is a sad ending to Group B racing, we cannot ignore all the amazing cars it brought into the automotive scene. Cars like the Audi Quattro made a name for itself by winning one of the World Rally Championship's and starting the wave for four-wheel drive in rally racing. Also, cars like the Lancia Delta, the Peugot 205 T16, and the Ford Escort RS200 were famous for there performance alike.    </p><br>

        <h3>Audi Quattro</h3>
    <img id="AudiQ" src="Images/wrc-legend-walter-rohrl.jpg">
        <figcaption>
            The Audi Quattro was one of the best rally cars of its time. It was the first rally car to effectively and reliably use all-wheel drive and would go on to be a benchmark for future cars fitted with such a drivetrain. The Audi Quattro was equipped with an inline 5 DOHC engine that was connected to an experimental dual-clutch transmission that pushed over 500 horsepower. Before the abolition of Group B, the Audi Quattro took two World Rally Championships and a total of 23 World Rally Championship victories.

        <figcaption>
        The Lancia Delta S4 was another big competitor in group B rally becuase it's similar nature. The Lancia Delta S4 was equipped with an inline 4 DOHC engine pushing around 480 horsepower. It also had a four-wheel drive drivetrain similar to the Audi Quattro. The Lancia Delta also took advantage of the Group B regulations by featuring a midship-mounted engine and all-wheel drive system for superior traction on loose surfaces. The Lancia Delta took a total of five victories in the World Rally Championship before Group B was abolished.
