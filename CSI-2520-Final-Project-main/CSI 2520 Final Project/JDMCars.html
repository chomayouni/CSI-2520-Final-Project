    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p id="JDMHistory">Vehicles associated with the term JDM, also known as the Japanese Domestic Market, have gained a reputation of their own in past couple of decades. Starting with it's culture, most JDM cars are seen as japanese exclusive sports cars of the late 80s and 90s. While any car exclusicely sold in japan is a JDM car, cars like the Nissan R32 and R33, the Toyota 86, and the Mazda RX-7 FC and FD were the main focus when it came to JDM cars. These JDM cars gained popularity mainly becuase of their tuneability. This meant that each car had the ability to be tuned to a specific type of driving and even racing style. Back in the 90s these JDM cars were a staple when it came to illegal street racing. During this time in Japan, the most popular types of street racing were racing on the expressway and racing on the mountain passes. Starting with the iilegal street racing on the expressway, the most regarded place that people raced at was the shuto expressway in Tokyo. The most notorious racing group associated with this type of street racing was the Mid Night Club. This group became world famous for the speeds they would achieve on the expressway exceeding 300 km/h(190 mmph). While this group tried to stay hidden from the public as much as possible, their legacy still lives on in the culture of JDM. Moving on to mountain pass street racing, also know as touge, this type of racing also gave way for the JDM culture to strive to what it is today. Touge racing, called battles, are typically done at night between two cars essentially playing cat and mouse. The most common cars used in touge racing were usually lighter and smaller cars such as the AE86, Honda civic, Nissan silvia's, Nissan skyline's, and Mazda RX-7's. Touge racing was also made popular by the anime/manga series Initial D which is about the main character racing in his AE86 on the mountain passes. To this day the JDM culture still strives all over the world with different with many other car cultures putting their own twist to it.  </p><br>

        <figcaption>The Nissan Skyline GTR is consirded a legend to many JDM enthusiast. The R32 model(Shown in the picture) was coined as "Godzilla" becuase of its ability to annihalate competitors on the race track. With its RB26 twin-turbo straight six engine pushing 276 horsepower straight out of the factory. The GTR came with a four-wheel drive system that rivaled any other car manufactures four-wheel drive at the time. The GTR was also an extremely tuneable car. Groups like the Midnight Club were able to push the car over 300 km/h(190mph).    </figcaption>

    <img id="ae86" src="Images/1986-JDM-Toyota-AE86-Sprinter-Trueno-GT-Apex.jpg" width=300>
        <figcaption> At first glance the Toyota AE86 Corolla doesn't seem like anything special compared to the other japanese economy cars at the time but unlike the other cars, the 86 was truly a driver's car. Underneath the hatchback body lies a sophisticated sports car. Equipped with a independent front suspension, optional limited-slip differential, and most importanly, a spiffy four-cylinder engine linked to a 5-speed manual transmission which revs to 7600 rpm. While the car only makes 112 horsepower, the AE86 only weighs 2140 pounds. The AE86's popularity wasn't made just by it's specs, the Initial D anime/manga series was what really kicked this car into third gear.  </figcaption>

        <h3>Toyota Supra</h3>
    <img id="supra" src="Images/a80Supra.jpg" width=300>
        <figcaption>
        The Toyota A80 Supra is JDM legend for many reasons. To start, the supra came with the 2JZ-GE which was a 3.0 liter straight-six engine that pushed around 220 horsepower. While the horsepower may seem a bit low for a sports car, don't worry becuase Toyota had a turbocharged version of the supra. The supra turbo came with the 2JZ-GTE which was the same 3.0 liter straight-six enginge except now it has twin-turbos which pushed the car to 326 horsepower. Similar to most japanese sports cars of this era, the supra's 2JZ engine was extremely tuneable. The 2JZ has the capability of pushing up to 800 horsepower with only the stock internals. In the drifting scene, the 2JZ is used a lot when tuners want to engine swap their cars to get more power.
